# TanStack Query Project

This project demonstrates the use of the **TanStack Query** library with React, incorporating features such as **pagination**, **infinite scroll**, and basic **CRUD** operations. It uses `db.json` as the backend data source, serving data through `json-server`.

## Features

- **PostList1 & PostList2 Components**: Display lists of posts fetched from the API with pagination and infinite scroll examples.
- **Post Component**: Displays individual post details.
- **CreatePost Component**: Allows users to create new posts.
- **TanStack Query Integration**: Efficient data fetching, caching, and background synchronization.
- **Pagination Example**: Displays paginated posts from the backend.
- **Infinite Scroll Example**: Automatically loads more posts as the user scrolls.
